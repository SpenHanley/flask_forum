    Here we want to iterate through each of the users
    if they have a profile image we want to display that
    otherwise we will display a placeholder image.
    This will also link to the users profile page,
    may be an idea to allow users to choose whether
    they appear in the search results for users.
    Some other privacy features will also need to be
    implemented.
