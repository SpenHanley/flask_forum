Are we going to allow users to follow/add other users as friends on the site?
What other privacy features do we want to add
{
	The problem with this current question is what information
	do we want to ask users to add to their profile. Although
	any information that is part of their profile is automatically
	optional apart from the users email address and username, since
	they need this information to be able to register and log in.
	The more information that we ask the user for the more issues we
	are likely to have since if the information becomes personal we then
	need to register as a datacontroller with the information commissioners
	office.
